# How to Install
After cloning the repository onto your machine, run the following two commands:
- `npm install`
- `npm install uuidv4`

# Components
`TodoList` - renders `NewTodoForm` and all `Todo`
`NewTodoForm` - renders input form for user to enter new todo
`Todo` - renders Todo information with edit and delete button. Click to "complete" the todo.

# How it works
